Working with CEE and the Directorate of Education Goa involved creating a unique biodiversity map and a set of teacher's handbooks.

#### Teacher training handbooks focused on different aspects of biodiversity in Goa

This covered different issues and aspects of utilization and respect for the biodiversity in the state to help teachers disseminate this knowledge to school children.
